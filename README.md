This is a data cleaning project using the [Layoffs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/satishgunjal/layoffs-data) which contains information on global tech layoffs.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL (for cleaning and transformation)

- Standardized text formatting (e.g., lowercase, trimming whitespace)
- Handled null values
- Cleaned date formats
- Verified consistent naming for companies and locations

## 📌 Key Learnings
- Practiced SQL window functions and `ROW_NUMBER()`
- Understood real-world data issues like missing values and duplicates
- Got hands-on experience with GitHub for project hosting

## 📊 Next Steps
- Upload cleaned version of the CSV (optional)
- Add visuals or insights summary
- Possibly do exploratory data analysis (EDA) or basic dashboarding
